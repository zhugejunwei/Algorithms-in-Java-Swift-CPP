1. Return all words in the list with the prefix   that user searched for. And without traverse the list every time.
2. You have an array with words. Print them by anagrams groups  
3. Given two sparse Vectors, compute the Dot Product.
4. You have a user-submitted review (basically just a paragraph of 5ish sentences). Design and write an algorithm to break up the review into sentences, and put it in a list/array data structure. (The goal of this question, I think, was to see how you can cleverly figure out how to deal with non-standard punctuation) 
5. Tell me what happens when you type yelp.com  
6. I was asked to implement a function to take a collection of SET cards and identify a set if it exists or return a error status or something similar if it does not. This is according to the rules of teh game "SET" which you should look up for context
7. Design LRU Cache 
8. Subtract two strings  
9. Given a list of threads with a start time and finish time, determine all the threads with overlapping times
10. Given a string, print true or false if you can create a palindrome with it. 
11. Create a cache for data on a webpage to avoid calling the server whenever possible.  
How to implement a cache for yelp website. 
12. How would you make a Spam detector for Yelp given all the data. Another binary search tree coding question.
13. implement regex 
14. find the sum of two integers represented as strings, return the sum as string, i.e "123" and "456" would return "579". 
15. How to find the only different number in two unsorted arrays?
16. How to design a request dispatcher for load balancing
17. Write code to generate all possible case combinations of a given lower-cased string. (e.g. "0ab" -&gt; ["0ab", "0aB", "0Ab", "0AB"])  
18. I only had one coding question that was to find the maximum number of segments that could fit on a number line given a list of segments. 
19. given an array of intervals, return max number of non-overlapping intervals  
20. Longest Palindrome Substring 
21. Split shifted linked list into two sorted lists.  
22. It is about interval selecting.
